# Github 

1. To get Contribution 
let contribution = document.querySelector('.js-yearly-contributions h2')
2. Getting Top Repositories
(As there can be forked repos also, and we dont have to include them, we will filter them out )
let allPersonalRepo = document.querySelectorAll('#user-repositories-list li.source')
